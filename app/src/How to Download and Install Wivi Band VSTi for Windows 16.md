## What is Wivi Band VSTi?
 
Wivi Band VSTi is a software instrument that simulates wind instruments using physical modeling synthesis. Physical modeling synthesis is a technique that uses mathematical equations to describe the physical properties and interactions of sound-producing objects such as tubes, valves, reeds, bells and mouthpieces. By solving these equations in real time, Wivi Band VSTi can generate realistic and expressive sounds that respond to the player's input and articulation.
 
Wivi Band VSTi includes 10 different wind instruments: Bb-Trumpet, Tenor Trombone, French Horn, F-Tuba, Concert Flute, A-Clarinet, Modern Oboe, Modern Bassoon, Tenor Saxophone and Soprano Recorder. Each instrument has its own characteristics and features such as mute types, vibrato types, key noise and breath noise. Wivi Band VSTi also allows you to play solo or in sections of up to 8 players with automatic divisi. Divisi is a musical term that means dividing a section of players into smaller groups that play different parts. For example, you can have a section of 4 trumpets playing in harmony or in unison with Wivi Band VSTi.
