The film traces the origins of Death Row Records, which was founded in 1992 by Dr. Dre, Suge Knight, the D.O.C., and Dick Griffey. [^2^] Dr. Dre was a former member of N.W.A., a pioneering group of gangsta rap that had a bitter split with its leader Eazy-E over financial disputes.   Suge Knight, a former bodyguard and football player, allegedly used intimidation and violence to free Dr. Dre from his contract with Eazy-E's Ruthless Records.   The D.O.C., a former rapper and songwriter for N.W.A., had lost his voice in a car accident and became a mentor and ghostwriter for Dr. Dre.  Dick Griffey, a veteran music executive and founder of Solar Records, provided financial backing and industry connections for the new label.
 
Death Row Records quickly rose to prominence in the rap scene with the release of Dr. Dre's debut solo album The Chronic in 1992, which featured Snoop Dogg as his protÃ©gÃ© and main collaborator. The album was a critical and commercial success, selling over six million copies and earning a Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance for the single "Let Me Ride". The album also introduced the G-funk style of rap music, which combined funk samples, synthesizers, and melodic hooks with hardcore lyrics about street life, drugs, sex, and violence. [^2^]
 
The label's next major release was Snoop Dogg's debut album Doggystyle in 1993, which was also produced by Dr. Dre and featured guest appearances by Tha Dogg Pound, Nate Dogg, Warren G, and others. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart and sold over five million copies, making Snoop Dogg one of the most popular rappers of the decade. The album also spawned several hit singles, such as "Who Am I (What's My Name)?", "Gin and Juice", and "Murder Was the Case". The latter song was inspired by Snoop Dogg's real-life murder trial, in which he was accused of killing a rival gang member in 1993. He was eventually acquitted in 1996 with the help of his lawyer Johnnie Cochran. [^2^]
